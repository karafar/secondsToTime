I was talking to somebody about time keeping, and converting to seconds into year, month, day, etc.. I wrote this up real quickly.
This is the simplest solution. We used whole numbers to derive our seconds, but we could have more accurate numbers.
The subject of time keeping is interesting when you get into the details of it.
